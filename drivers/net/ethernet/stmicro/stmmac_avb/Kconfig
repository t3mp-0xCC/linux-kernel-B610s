	bool "STMMAC Platform bus support"
	depends on NEW_STMMAC_ETH
	default y
	---help---
	  This selects the platform specific bus support for
	  the stmmac device driver. This is the driver used
	  on many embedded STM platforms based on ARM and SuperH
	  processors.
	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

	depends on NEW_STMMAC_ETH && PCI
	---help---
	  This is to select the Synopsys DWMAC available on PCI devices,
	  if you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  This PCI support is tested on XLINX XC2V3000 FF1152AMT0221
	  D1215994A VIRTEX FPGA board.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NEW_STMMAC_DA
	bool "STMMAC DMA arbitration scheme"
	default n
	---help---
	  Selecting this option, rx has priority over Tx (only for Giga
	  Ethernet device).
	  By default, the DMA arbitration scheme is based on Round-robin
	  (rx:tx priority is 1:1).

config NEW_STMMAC_IPF_SIM
