/**
* struct android_dev - represents android USB gadget device
* @name: device name.
* @functions: an array of all the supported USB function
*    drivers that this gadget support but not necessarily
*    added to one of the gadget configurations.
* @cdev: The internal composite device. Android gadget device
*    is a composite device, such that it can support configurations
*    with more than one function driver.
* @dev: The kernel device that represents this android device.
* @enabled: True if the android gadget is enabled, means all
*    the configurations were set and all function drivers were
*    bind and ready for USB enumeration.
* @disable_depth: Number of times the device was disabled, after
*    symmetrical number of enables the device willl be enabled.
*    Used for controlling ADB userspace disable/enable requests.
* @mutex: Internal mutex for protecting device member fields.
* @pdata: Platform data fetched from the kernel device platfrom data.
* @connected: True if got connect notification from the gadget UDC.
*    False if got disconnect notification from the gadget UDC.
* @sw_connected: Equal to 'connected' only after the connect
*    notification was handled by the android gadget work function.
* @suspended: True if got suspend notification from the gadget UDC.
*    False if got resume notification from the gadget UDC.
* @sw_suspended: Equal to 'suspended' only after the susped
*    notification was handled by the android gadget work function.
* @pm_qos: An attribute string that can be set by user space in order to
*    determine pm_qos policy. Set to 'high' for always demand pm_qos
*    when USB bus is connected and resumed. Set to 'low' for disable
*    any setting of pm_qos by this driver. Default = 'high'.
* @work: workqueue used for handling notifications from the gadget UDC.
* @configs: List of configurations currently configured into the device.
*    The android gadget supports more than one configuration. The host
*    may choose one configuration from the suggested.
* @configs_num: Number of configurations currently configured and existing
*    in the android_configs list.
* @list_item: This driver supports more than one android gadget device (for
*    example in order to support multiple USB cores), therefore this is
*    a item in a linked list of android devices.
